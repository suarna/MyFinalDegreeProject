Estudio de prestaciones de un entorno de IoT mediante herramientas de simulaci√≥n de software libre

ABSTRACT
Internet of Things (IoT) networks are causing a paradigm shift in the way we
understand the world. There is a huge amount of data captured by the small devices
that make up their networks and that are usually processed in the cloud. This, in turn, is
driving the development of new solutions with applications in many different fields, from
healthcare to agriculture, through logistics and many more. Therefore, these technologies
are applicable to all productive sectors.
The networks that make up the IoT are composed mainly of wireless devices,
meaning that the transmission medium is air. Radio communications are generally used.
This represents a great challenge when trying to know how the preliminary design will
behave in real operating conditions due to the heterogeneous environments where they
are implemented, the spectrum saturation, and the fact that, generally, unlicensed bands
are used for communication. As all technologies compete for the same resources, they
must be very efficient in their use, adopting tools to combat the interference caused by the
different networks and technologies that make use of these bands.
In order to minimise this issue, simulators are used. Applying the appropriate
parameters, it is possible to know how a network would respond in conditions which are
close to reality. This, in turn, allows researchers to adopt solutions in the design phase,
saving costs.
This paper aims to survey the existing technologies, protocols and types of networks
used in IoT deployments, explain the operation of one of the most used network simulators
in research such as NS-3 and implement a specific solution, thus testing the simulator's
performance in a real case study.
